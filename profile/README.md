## The Problem

Online harassment is a critical social issue, disproportionately affecting women and marginalized communities. Existing anti-harassment tools are often inadequate:
- **Reactive, not Proactive**: Users experience trauma *before* any action can betaken.
- **Ineffective Blocking**: Traditional blocking can escalate the situation, as harassers simply create new accounts.
- **Lack of Evidence**: Manually collecting evidence for legal action is difficult, stressful, and often incomplete.
- **Slow Manual Reporting**: Platform reporting systems are slow and often ineffective, leaving victims unprotected.

## üå± A Note on Our Development Journey

As a project born from the fast-paced and dynamic environment of hackathons, our codebase was migrated between private repositories several times during its initial development. This was necessary to meet deadlines and adapt to evolving requirements.

Consequently, the commit history visible here doesn't fully capture the extensive, iterative process‚Äîand the hundreds of commits‚Äîthat went into building Safire from the ground up. The current history reflects the final, polished state of the project as we prepared it for the public.

We share this note to provide context on our journey and to give a nod to the immense effort, late nights, and passion our team poured into bringing this idea to life.
